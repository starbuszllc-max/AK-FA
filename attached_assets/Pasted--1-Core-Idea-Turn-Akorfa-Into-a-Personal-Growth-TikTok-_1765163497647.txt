⭐ 1. Core Idea: Turn Akorfa Into a “Personal Growth TikTok”

Your platform already has:

Layers

Engagement

To monetize like TikTok, you add:

Engagement-based creator earnings

Reward points → money

Sponsored challenges

Paid mentor creators

In-app purchases

Digital coins

Ads (optional)

⭐ 2. Reward System (Points → Money)

Users earn Akorfa Points (AP) for:

Action	AP Earned
Posting	+5
Getting likes	+1 each
Getting comments	+2 each
Completing a challenge	+10
Daily streak	+3
High Assessment Score	+20
Helping others / coaching	+30

Then convert:

1,000 AP = $1


You can set this ANY way you want.
